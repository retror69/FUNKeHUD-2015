There are 2 different font options for health and ammo:
  
-Newtown (default)  
-Bebas Neue  
They can be enabled/disabled by going to the "options" folder and dragging+dropping the option you want into the "enabled" folder.

Speedometer can be enabled/disabled by going to the "options" folder and dragging+dropping it into the "enabled" folder.

Transparent viewmodels can be enabled/disabled through the "hudlayout.res" file in the "scripts" folder.
