# FUNKeHud-Edit by retror
There are 3 different font options for health and ammo:
  
-Newtown (default)  
-Piximisa  
-DOCK11  
They can be enabled/disabled by going to the "options" folder and dragging+dropping the option you want into the "enabled" folder.

Transparent viewmodels, crosshairs, and hitmarker can be enabled/disabled through the "hudlayout.res" file in the "scripts" folder.

Loadout BG can be enabled/disabled through the "classloadoutpanel.res" file in the "resource/ui" folders.
