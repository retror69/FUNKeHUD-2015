They can be enabled/disabled by going to the "options" folder and dragging+dropping the option you want into the "enabled" folder.

Transparent viewmodels, crosshairs, and hitmarker can be enabled/disabled through the "hudlayout.res" file in the scripts folder.

Loadout BG can be enabled/disabled through the "classloadoutpanel.res" file in the scripts folder.
